#there are two apps

1-app is for student side

2-app is for security side

1.app ->
    this contains student details and ask for reason of going out and time when they are coming in.

    #the main part of this is it will generate a random QR code for each time.
    
    #only 50% done - that is for Entry(i.e is Going out)
    
    #remaining 50% is Exit(i.e is Coming in) for that I have to make a software

2.app ->
    this app is a scanning part

    this  will scan the qr generated by the 1-app and it will pass to the database
    
    #50% that is for scanning Entry(i.e is going out)
    
    #remaining 50% is Exit (i.e is Coming in) for that I have to make a software.

#totaly 80% done 
need to make some changes in Exit_QR_Scanning
